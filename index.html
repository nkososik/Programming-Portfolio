      <h4><strong>About Me:</strong></h4>
        <p>While I am newer to the world of software and web development, I have had an enriching experience in both my <em>professional</em> and <em>academic</em> careers that I believe will lead me to become a blooming junior developer in the coming months! My background is primarily in the ecological sciences as I have a B.S. in Environmental Biology from <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/">Boise State University</a>. However, my work experience expands on the knowledge I worked through by including a variety of landscaping work, HVAC system and irrigation system maintenance, wildlife education, university advising/tutoring, wildlife and natural system research, data management, GIS map-making, as well as customer/client services and communications. While the scale of my career and knowledge is not hyper-focused to one field, I believe it shows my interests in pursuing new skills and new areas of information in order to become a more rounded individual within my community and for myself. Enrolling at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> has allowed me to begin expanding my personal toolkit and will hopefully lead to both a better understanding of developer/development systems as well as a better understanding of myself as I continually pursue my goals in higher education. Please scroll down below to see a list of my projects at Epicodus thus far!</p>
